Another project from 2nd year Algorithms & Data Structures. Here is the readme that was included with it:

everything's very straightforward and set up through the Makefile..

just run "make", then try giving the different programs different inputs or outputs

there's a testing suite I wrote on the sub-folder called "testing".

Most of the testing is done with 2 programs:
	-> testing/script.sh:

	A shell script which generates a type of
	input, feeds it to the algorithm, and
	feeds the clusters into the R-program to
	export it to PDF.
	Try editing it before executing it.

	-> ./test_all:

	A C program which performs a group of
	specific tests on the programs.
